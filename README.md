# LionSoraSephiroth

Thanks to DA for the start since he made his antiform sora mod. Also thanks to Rapid and Zurph in the OpenKH disc for help on other aspects.

Play as Lion Sora Everywhere but Pooh minigames that aren't spooky cave. Some RCs may miss try again/get closer. 
You'll want thunder for boat pete and a form helps but if you let Lion Sora fall of the hook you'll keep hitting the cage after getting back on.
Data Axel is now Axel 2 so you can beat him and he's a little bit easier ofc.

Nothing is impossible anymore and most animations look normalish.

Thanks to DA for even starting something similar to this I could work off of since I woulnt have had any idea where to start. Also for specifying which msets slot were which in terms of movement etc.

Again thanks to Rapid and Zurph from the OpenKH discord. Rapid for fixing and making the working lion model by adding bones correctly which I couldnt do and Zurph for mset editing help and fixing the chests so they use Lion Soras animations(although it does mess up Sora's forms but thats just funny to me and probably even more im forgetting.
